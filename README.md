# Share Pin - Pinterest Clone

Share Pin is a web application inspired by Pinterest, built using React with Tailwind CSS for the front-end and Sanity.io for the backend.

## Description

Share Pin allows users to discover and save images, creating personalized collections of visual inspiration. Users can browse through a wide variety of pins, organized by different categories and themes. By clicking on a pin, users can view a larger image and additional details. They can save pins to their own collections, share them with others, and follow other users with similar interests.
